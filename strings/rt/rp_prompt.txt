<b>The year is 1521.</b> You are on the land known as 'TEMPERANCE,' a large continent that supports two major factions: The Great Empire of Perserdun and the Risvonian Ziggurate.
<br>
<br>
Ten years ago - strange, hyperfuturistic factories dubbed as 'MACHINES' started to appear in TEMPERANCE. They are the Machine of Love, Life, and War.
<br>
<br>
<b>LOVE</b> brought ideas, foreign culture, and curious devices like the 'radio.'
<br>
<br>
<b>LIFE</b> brought various medical wonders. It taught people the idea of microbes, and created things such as concrete.
<br>
<br>
<b>WAR</b> brought rifles, bombs - gas masks, and artillery guns.
<br>
<br>
You find yourself on the City-State of King's Row, a place heavily benefited by the exclusive surgence of various MACHINE-related dungeons known as 'OUTLETs'.
<br>
<br>
The <b>Empire</b> demands loyalty and expansion. They love to show others the might and will of their God-King 'Rab.' 
<br>
The <b>Ziggurate</b> crushes those beneath it. They are strong - the others? Weak. From the Inheritor-Dunes of Risvon, to the great West - they seek to conquer all.
<br>
<b>King's Row</b> wishes to keep their way of life alive. Peace makes for the best riches, but war makes for good business as well.
<br>
<br>
The Empire and the Ziggurate are natural enemies. One must conquer the other.
