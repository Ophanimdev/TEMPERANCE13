Something dull beats beneath the earth.
None of this is real.
I want to go home.
Something evil is underneath the earth.
What's the point of it all?
Let's go home. I'm tired.
Abuse has consumed me. I'm not long for this world.
My heart starts to rapidly beat. I don't feel right.
I'm corrupt.
I can only blame myself, for this situation.
Everything is so loud. 
I'm scared.
I'm alone.
Why did you put me in this hell?
I want my mother.
Where's home?
Not even a dirty whore can comfort me.
Suck my fat doggy cock.
No progress, no gain. Why do we even fight?
We're pawns for the slaughter. The King does not move.
The sun is warm, yet I feel so cold.
Is this our purgatory?
I miss my mom.
You won't write great stories without experiencing life and having at least a modicum of interest in other people. 
Creating in a vacuum is an act of vanity and narcissism.
I ache. Everything aches.
This wasn't how they said it'd be.
An eternal rest doesn't sound all that bad.
